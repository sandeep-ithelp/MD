# GitFlow

## Warning - Do not use!
GitFlow introduces **rigid branching patterns** that can **slow down** modern CI/CD workflows, making it less ideal for fast-paced teams embracing trunk-based development or continuous deployment.

Here's a example of GitFlow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[main] --> B[develop]
    B --> C[feature/login]
    C --> B
    B --> D[feature/payment]
    D --> B
    B --> E[release/1.0.0]
    E --> F[hotfix/login-bug]
    F --> E
    E --> A
    E --> B
    A --> G[tag v1.0.0]
